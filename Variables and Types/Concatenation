This process simply joins two strings together. In Python, you can concatenate two strings using the + operator, much like you'd add numbers.

Concatenation won't automatically insert spaces between the strings you're joining.
For example:
# Article and word
article = "The"
country = "Netherlands"
# Output result of the concatenations
print(article + country)
print(article + " " + country) # Add blank space between

o/p:
TheNetherlands
The Netherlands

Keep in mind, you can only concatenate strings with other strings. In other words, you can't directly concatenate a word like 'word' with a number such as 1. To achieve this, first convert the number to a string using the str(1) function, and then concatenate.
