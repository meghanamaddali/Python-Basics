what if you want to grab several consecutive characters? Sure, you can pick them out individually, but that seems a tad tedious, doesn't it?

It sure does. To retrieve multiple characters in one go, you can use a technique called slicing. For this, employ square brackets and denote the beginning and end indices with a colon : in between. It's crucial to note that the end index isn't included. So, when you use [1:5], you're selecting characters at indices 1 through 4. Check out the example below.

Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Index:    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Word:     c o d e f i n i t y 

As you'll notice, the end position is always one more than the last character's index you want to include. In the above example, there are 10 positions, but the final index is 9.
