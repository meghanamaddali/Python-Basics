Welcome to section three! In this section, we'll dive into another Python data type: the boolean or logical type. Booleans can only have one of two values: True or False. This data type comes into play when evaluating logical conditions.

Here are the logical operators for comparison:

== equal to;
!= not equal to;
> greater than;
< less than;
>= greater than or equal to;
<= less than or equal to.

When you apply these operators, the result will be a boolean value: True if the condition is met, and False if it isn't. For instance, consider the following evaluations:

# Check if 1 equals 1
print(1 == 1)
# Check if "abc" equals "aBc"
print("abc" == "aBc")
# Check if 87*731 greater than or equal to 98*712
print(87*731 >= 98*712)

True
False
False
