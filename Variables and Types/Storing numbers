Variables in programming act like placeholders for data. 
What if you want to use those number again while coding? 
Doing the math all over again doesn't make much sense.

To remember a value for later, we give it a name by using a variable. The equals sign "=" lets us set a value for that variable. For instance, you can set the variable "year" to the value "2024", and from there, you can display it or do more math with it.
