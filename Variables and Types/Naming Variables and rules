When naming variables in Python, there are some rules and best practices 
to keep in mind:

-> Variable names can include letters, numbers, or underscores:
myVariable1;
number_2;
data_frame3;
Python4Life;
_underscoreVar.

-> Variable names can't start with a number:
variable1 (Correct);
1variable (Incorrect - starts with a number).

-> Variable names are case-sensitive:
MyVariable and myvariable are different variables;
Data and data are different variables;
Number1 and number1 are different variables.

-> Apart from the underscore _, special characters aren't allowed:
my_variable (Correct);
my-variable (Incorrect - contains a hyphen);
variable@name (Incorrect - contains an @);
data*star (Incorrect - contains an asterisk *).

-> Reserved words in Python can't be used as variable names:
forLoop (Correct - not a reserved word);
ifCondition (Correct - not a reserved word);
for (Incorrect - for is a reserved word);
while (Incorrect - while is a reserved word);
try (Incorrect - try is a reserved word).
